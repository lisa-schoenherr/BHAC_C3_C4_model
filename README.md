# Implementation of the BHAC into a C3 model
Supplementary files for the work on my pre-thesis "Computational modelling of a photorespiratory bypass in C3 metabolism".


Files: 

1. BHAC_C3_model_analyses - main jupyter notebook containing all the analyses and plots 
2. c3_model - xml file of the further developed C3 model
3. PlantCoreMetabolism - SBML file of the core plant model
4. model_functions - containing additional user-written functions for working with COBRApy
5. Final_Biomass - contains values for the biomass reaction for Arabidopsis and Maize

Files 3 to 5 are used in the notebook and uploaded here to ensure full functionality, but credits for these files go to: https://github.com/Toepfer-Lab/Metabolic_Plasticity_C4

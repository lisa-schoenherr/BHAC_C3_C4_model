# Implementation of the BHAC into a C3 and C4 model
Supplementary files for the work on my bachelor thesis "Computational modelling of a photorespiratory bypass in C3 metabolism to establish a synthetic C4 cycle".


Files: 

1. BHAC_C3_model_analyses - jupyter notebook containing all the analyses and plots for the one-cell C3 model
2. BHAC_C4_model_analyses - jupyter notebook containing all the analyses and plots for the two-cell C4 model
3. c3_model - xml file of the further developed C3 model
4. c4_model - xml file of the further developed C4 model
5. PlantCoreMetabolism - SBML file of the core plant model
6. model_functions - containing additional user-written functions for working with COBRApy
7. Final_Biomass - contains values for the biomass reaction for Arabidopsis and Maize

Files 5 to 7 are used in the notebook and uploaded here to ensure full functionality, but credits for these files go to: https://github.com/Toepfer-Lab/Metabolic_Plasticity_C4
